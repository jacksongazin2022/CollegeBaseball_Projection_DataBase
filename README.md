# CollegeBaseball_Projection_DataBase
Using Division 1 Stats to forecast minor league performance
This project gives you the tools to create your own college database which can be used for predictive purposes. My finished product was an algorithm that predicted minor league hitting performance based on college hitting performance. Chadwick Bureau's Database is a great starting point and is ideal for this
project. Once downloaded these programs will append each drafted college player's minor league stats to his college stats from the database which can be used to train an algorithm to predict minor league performance from college performance.
